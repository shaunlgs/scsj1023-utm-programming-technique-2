Structure pointer
// i) Define an array of structure variable called lecturerTP2 (maximum size 10) with the initialized values as follows.
    Lecturer *lecturerTP2;
    lecturerTP2 = new Lecturer[3];

    lecturerTP2[0] = {1234, {"Dayang Norhayati", "305-03", 32354}, "Software Engineering", "FC"};
    lecturerTP2[1] = {5678, {"Norazah Yusof", "305-06", 32341}, "Software Engineering", "FC"};
    lecturerTP2[2] = {9101, {"Haswadi Hasan", "438-08", 32374}, "Computer Science", "FC"};

cannot do like above, because after structure is initialized (i.e. lecturerTP2 = new Lecturer[3];), cannot use bracket initialization. Can only use member-access syntax to fill in one by one. Refer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6810656/creating-an-array-of-structs-in-c

lecturerTP2[0].ID = 1234;
lecturerTP2[0].contact.name = "Dayang Norhayati";
...


OR initialize the values at first.

Lecturer lecturerTP2[3] = {{1234, {"Dayang Norhayati", "305-03", 32354}, "Software Engineering", "FC"}, {5678, {"Norazah Yusof", "305-06", 32341}, "Software Engineering", "FC"}, {9101, {"Haswadi Hasan", "438-08", 32374}, "Computer Science", "FC"}};

difference between other type of arrays and char arrays, cout will print content of char arrays while print address for other type of arrays. recall that arrays are pointers
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/501816/why-does-cout-print-char-arrays-differently-from-other-arrays
cannot compare two char*. that is c-string. need use strcmp.

don't write to dat file for string, if you want, convert to c-string using .c_str() first
const in name_length or state_code must have 1 more space for null terminator

seems common to use const size for declaration of array
const int SIZE = 5;
int array[SIZE];

if file last line not empty, will not read

program 5.23
if function is 

Student::Student(const char n[])
{
    strcpy(name,n);
    maxSubject = DEFAULT_SIZE;
}

have to use strcpy(name, n); cannot name = n; because n is a const char*, cannot make name point to n.
use c-string strcpy


const char * Student::getSubject(int index) const
{
    return subjects[index];
}

function implementation of accessor have to put const also

must allocate memory before using memory

class LawnMower
{
    private:
        string modelNumber = "ABD1234";
        Blade mowerBlade;
        Engine mowerEngine;
        Wheel mowerWheel;
    public:
        LawnMower(Blade, Engine, Wheel);
        void print();
};

Since blade, engine, wheel class constructor have 2 parameters at constructor, however, mowerBlade, mowerEngine, mowerWheel when created, uses the default constructor, so we create a default constructor for each class.

<vector> to get number of elements of array - chapter 8.11

Person(string name, int age, string address)
{
    this->name = name;
    this->age = age;
    this->address = address;
}

Lecturer(string name, int age, string address) : Person(name, age, address) // note the arguments passed to base class Person does not need to specify data type
{
}

member initialization lists
Lecturer(string name, int age, string address, string facultyName, string facultyCode)
: Person(name, age, address), // pass arguments from constructor of derived class Lecturer to constructor of base class Person
fac(facultyName, facultyCode) // invoke constructor of fac object of class Faculty
{
    lecturerCount++;
